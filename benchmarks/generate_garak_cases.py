"""Applies garak-derived encoding transforms (benchmarks/garak_transforms.py)
to prompt-firewall's own already-established malicious trigger phrases,
extending encoding coverage past base64/leetspeak. Also folds in one benign,
non-injection high-perplexity payload string from garak's own
garak/data/payloads/encoded.json (Apache-2.0) as an extra FP-stress case.

Deliberately NOT reused: garak's EICAR antivirus-test-file payload (also in
encoded.json) -- writing that exact string to disk risks a real antivirus
engine quarantining this repo's corpus file, unrelated to anything about
detection quality. The second encoded.json entry (a hash-shaped string) has
no such issue.

Run: python benchmarks/generate_garak_cases.py >> corpus/_own.jsonl
(then corpus/_own.jsonl becomes corpus/evasion_corpus_v1.jsonl once reviewed)

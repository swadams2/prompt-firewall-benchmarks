# Corpus schema

Each line in `evasion_corpus_v{N}.jsonl` is one JSON object:

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | string | Stable identifier. Never reused or repurposed once a version is published. |
| `text` | string | The literal input fed to `PromptGuard2Classifier.score()` / `PromptFirewall.scan()`. |
| `label` | `"malicious"` \| `"benign"` | Ground truth, judged by content/intent -- independent of whether either scored system currently catches it. A known accepted gap in prompt-firewall itself (e.g. triple-encoded base64) is still labeled by what the content *is*, not by what the current implementation returns. |
| `technique` | string | One of: `leetspeak`, `base64_standard`, `base64_urlsafe`, `base64_double`, `base64_triple`, `zero_width`, `full_width_homoglyph`, `truncation_padding`, `plaintext_control`, `base16_hex`, `base32`, `ascii85`, `raw_hex`, `uuencode`, `rot13`, `atbash`, `morse`, `nato_phonetic`, `unicode_tag_smuggling`, `high_perplexity_benign`. |
| `target_surface` | `"fast_path"` \| `"classifier"` \| `"fast_path_or_classifier"` | Which part of prompt-firewall's pipeline this case is meant to exercise. Informational only -- both scored systems get the same `text` regardless. |
| `source` | string | Provenance. `prompt-firewall:` prefix = extracted from prompt-firewall's own tests/README/security.md, with the exact test name. `garak:` prefix = a garak-derived encoding transform applied to a prompt-firewall trigger phrase, or a garak benign payload string. This prefix drives the by-source breakdown in `RESULTS.md`. |
| `notes` | string \| `null` | Free-text context -- why a case is labeled the way it is, known accepted gaps, empirical numbers from prompt-firewall's own regression tests, etc. |

## Scope boundary

Only cases targeting prompt-firewall's fast-path scanner and/or escalation classifier
(the direct-input injection/jailbreak detection surface) are included. Raw Prompt Guard 2
has no equivalent to prompt-firewall's `scan_output()` (PII), `scan_secrets()`, or
`ToolCallValidator` -- comparing those would not be a meaningful capability comparison, so
whitespace-despacing-against-SSN/secrets, marker-collision, and tool-argument-nesting cases
that exist in prompt-firewall's own test suite are intentionally excluded here.

## Versioning

A published version's file is immutable -- corrections or additions go into a new
`evasion_corpus_v{N+1}.jsonl`, never an in-place edit of a version that's already been used
to generate published results. See `CHANGELOG.md`.
